 The  following script provides the code needed to create a EFLALO dataset from
 IFISH database. The EFLALO format here provided is a modification of the standard 
 EFLALO format , adpating the SPECIES columns  to perform better with SQL queries.
   Instead to have a field for weight and value by species and by log event (LE_ ), it
 has a column for species , one for weight and one for value and LE_ID is repeated 
 for each species captured during that LE_ID . Then the species columns can be easily
 pivoted into EFLALO standard format in R enviroment and then be used with  VMSTools for further analysis
